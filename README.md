# MOD300 Project 4 

Repository for the subject MOD300, Applied Python Coding and Modeling. For the fourth project. 

The project combines both unsupervised and supervised learning approaches.
The unsupervised learning part focuses on the study of the Milky Way using the mw_plot library. This includes generating and visualizing different regions of the galaxy through multiple encodings such as Dark, Grey, Red and Blue, and applying K-means clustering to identify patterns such as dust clouds, nebulae and stellar regions.

The supervised learning part deals with modeling Ebola outbreaks in several countries. Different techniques are explored, including linear and polynomial regression, a classic feed-forward neural network and an LSTM model, in order to perform time-series predictions and compare these machine-learning methods with more traditional modeling approaches.

The project is organized into two main Python files. The file supervised_learning.py contains the functions used for the supervised learning analyses, while the file unsupervised_learning.py includes the topic1_generation class and the functions related to the unsupervised learning tasks. All these components are integrated into the Project_4 notebook, which provides examples, explanations and visualizations of the obtained results
